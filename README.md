### BinderHub and Microsoft Azure Notebook
#### Using BinderHub
After clicking on the "launch binder" link above, wait for a few minutes to BinderHub build the Docker container.

#### Using Microsoft Azure Notebook
This service seems to be continuously being improved by Microsoft so notebooks launch process might break anytime. After launching a notebook or terminal, you may see a popup window that looks like the one below. It means MS Azure has not completely built the Jupyter Notebook container yet. When the popup window to disappears, this means all the packages have been installed.
